# 12. HAL Library I2C



## I2C Introduction

IIC (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus is a two-wire serial bus developed by NXP (formerly PHILIPS) for connecting microcontrollers and their peripherals. It is mostly used for master-slave communication between master controllers and slave devices, used in situations with small data volumes, short transmission distances, and only one master at any time.

Bidirectional transmission is carried out between the CPU and the controlled IC, and between ICs. The high-speed IIC bus can generally reach more than 400kbps.

PS: Please note that IIC was invented to communicate with low-speed devices, so the transmission rate of IIC is not as good as SPI.


### IIC physical layer

**IIC has only two buses: one is the bidirectional data line SDA, and the other is the serial clock line SCL**.

All serial data SDA connected to the I2C bus devices are connected to the SDA of the bus, and the clock line SCL of each device is connected to the SCL of the bus. Each device on the I2C bus corresponds to a unique address.

**IIC start signal and stop signal:**

- Start signal : SCL maintains high level, after SDA changes from high level to low level, there is a delay (>4.7us), and then SCL changes to low level.
- Stop signal : SCL remains at high level. SDA changes from low level to high level.

![02](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/02.jpg)

### Data Validity

**During the data transmission process of the IIC signal, when SCL=1 high level, the data line SDA must remain stable and no level jump is allowed. The high or low level state of the data line is allowed to change only when the signal on the clock line is low level.**

**When SCL=1, any level change of the data line SDA will be regarded as the start signal or stop signal of the bus.**

That is, during the IIC data transmission process, the SCL clock line will frequently change levels to ensure data transmission.

### Response signal

**Whenever the host sends a byte of data to the slave, the host always needs to wait for the slave to give a response signal to confirm whether the slave has successfully received the data.**

**Response signal: The host pulls up SCL and reads the level of the slave SDA. A low level indicates a response**.

When the response signal is at a low level, it is defined as a valid response bit (ACK, abbreviated as response bit), indicating that the receiver has successfully received the byte;
when the response signal is at a high level, it is defined as a non-response bit (NACK), generally indicating that the receiver has not successfully received the byte.

![05](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/05.jpg)

**Each time a byte (8 bits) is sent**, during the ninth clock period after 8 clocks of a byte transmission, **the receiver must send an ACK response signal to the transmitter after receiving the data**, so that data transmission can be carried out.

The response appears in the clock cycle immediately following each time the host completes the transmission of 8 data bits. A low level 0 indicates a response, and a 1 indicates a non-response.

## Take AT24C02 as an example

24C02 is a 2K-bit serial EEPROM memory (power-off does not lose), containing 256 bytes. There is an 8-byte page write buffer inside 24C02.

![07](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/07.jpg)

- A0, A1, A2: Hardware address pins
- WP: Write protection pin, high level read-only, grounding allows reading and writing
- SCL and SDA: IIC bus

**The storage capacity of the chip can be calculated by the model of the storage IC. For example, the 02 after 24C02 means that it can store 2Kbit of data, and the storage capacity converted to bytes is 21024/8 = 256bytes. Then the 04 after 24C04 means that it can store 4Kbit of data, and the storage capacity converted to bytes is 41024/8 = 512bytes. The storage space of other models can be inferred in this way.**

**The following figure shows the chip slave address:**

It can be seen that for different sizes of 24Cxx, there are different slave device addresses. Since 24C02 has a capacity of 2k, that is to say, only the content of the first line in the figure needs to be referred to:
![08](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/08.jpg)

Chip addressing: (寻址)
The AT24C device address is as follows, the first four bits are fixed to 1010, and **A2~A0 are the pin levels. The AT24CXX EEPROM Board module is grounded by default. So A2~A0 defaults to 000** , and the last bit indicates a read and write operation. So the read address of AT24Cxx is 0xA1, and the write address is 0xA0.

That is to say,
**when writing 24C02 , the slave device address is 10100000 (0xA0);**
**when reading 24C02, the slave device address is 10100001 (0xA1).**

### Chip Inner Addressing:

**The chip addressing can perform read/write operations on any of the internal 256Bs, and its addressing range is 00~FF, with a total of 256 addressing units.**

Just modify the three bits of data A2A1A0 accordingly can easily achieve the Chip Inner addressing.

## **Write data to AT24C02**

![10](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/10.jpg)

Operation sequence:

1. The MCU first sends a start signal (START) to start the bus

2. Then follow the first byte and send the device write **operation address (DEVICE ADDRESS) + write data (0xA0)**
3. Waiting for the ACK signal
4. **The storage address of the sent data (Word Address)**. 24C02 has a total of 256 bytes of storage space, with addresses from 0x00 to 0xFF. You can write the address where you want to store the data.
5. Send the first byte, second byte, etc. of the data to be stored. Note that during the data writing process, each byte of E2PROM will respond with an "acknowledge bit 0", which tells us that writing E2PROM data is successful. If there is no acknowledge bit, it means that writing is unsuccessful.
6. **Send the end signal (STOP) to stop the bus**

Note:
During the data writing process, each time a byte is successfully written, **the address of the E2PROM storage space will automatically increase by 1**. When it reaches 0xFF, if another byte is written, the address will overflow and become 0x00 again.

When writing data, please note that E2PROM writes to the buffer first, and then "moves" to the power-off non-volatile area. So this process takes a certain amount of time, and the AT24C02 process does not exceed 5ms!
Therefore, when we write multiple bytes, after writing one byte, before writing the next byte, we must delay 5ms.

## **Reading data from AT24C02**

**1. Read data at the current address**

![11](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/11.jpg)

**2. Read data at a random address**

![12](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/12.jpg)

1. The MCU first sends a start signal (START) to start the bus

2. Then follow the first byte and send the device write operation address (DEVICE ADDRESS) + write data (0xA0). Note: The write operation here is to write the storage address of the data to be read first, telling the E2PROM which address to read the data.
3. Send the address of the memory to be read (WORD ADDRESS) to inform E2PROM which address to read.
4. Resend the start signal (START)
5. Send the device read operation address (DEVICE ADDRESS) to read the E2PROM (0xA1)
6. The E2PROM will automatically send data to the host, and the host reads the data sent back from the device. After reading a byte, the MCU will respond with an ACK signal, and the E2PROM will continue to transmit the data of the next address. The MCU can continuously respond to the ACK signal to continuously read the data in the memory.
7. If you do not want to read, tell the E2PROM that you do not want the data, and send a "non-acknowledge bit NAK (1)". Send an end signal (STOP) to stop the bus

**3. Continuous reading of data**

![13](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/13.jpg)

E2PROM supports continuous writing operation, which is similar to single byte operation. First send the device write operation address **(DEVICE ADDRESS)**, then send the memory start address **(WORD ADDRESS)**. After the MCU responds with an ACK signal (ACK), the E2PROM will continue to transmit the data of the next address. The MCU can continuously read the memory data by continuously responding to the ACK signal. The address pointer of the E2PROM will automatically increase, and the data will be saved in the memory in sequence. The transmission will be terminated

## IIC HAL library code part

You can see the IIC initialization function in the i2c.c file. You can see the I2C operation function in the stm32f1xx_hal_i2c.h header file. They correspond to the three control modes of polling, interrupt and DMA.
![14](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/12.%20HAL%20Library%20I2C.assets/14.jpg)

The above
For example, the IIC sending function is still a sending function, but there are several sending modes: normal sending, DMA transfer, and interrupt.

Here we only introduce the normal sending, and the others just need to change the function name

**IIC write function**

```c
 HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit(I2C_HandleTypeDef *hi2c, uint16_t DevAddress, uint8_t *pData, uint16_t Size, uint32_t Timeout);
```

Function: IIC write data
Parameters:

* Which IIC is used in hi2c setting? Example: &hi2c2
DevAddress writes the address to set the address of the written data, for example 0xA0
* pData data to be written
Size The number of bytes to send
Timeout is the maximum transmission time . If the transmission time is exceeded, the transmission function will be automatically exited.

**IIC read function**

```c
HAL_I2C_Master_Receive(I2C_HandleTypeDef *hi2c, uint16_t DevAddress, uint8_t *pData, uint16_t Size, uint32_t Timeout);
```

unction: IIC reads a byte
Parameters:

- hi2c: Set which IIC is used. Example: &hi2c2
- DevAddress: Write address Set the address of the written data, for example 0xA0

- pDat: a stores the read data
- Size: The number of bytes sent

- Timeout: Maximum reading time . If the time is exceeded, the reading function will be automatically exited.
  


Example

```c
HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit(&hi2c1,0xA1,(uint8_t*)TxData,2,1000) ；;
```

**IIC write data function**

```c

HAL_I2C_Mem_Write(I2C_HandleTypeDef *hi2c, uint16_t DevAddress, uint16_t MemAddress, uint16_t MemAddSize, uint8_t *pData, uint16_t Size, uint32_t Timeout);
/* 第1个参数为I2C操作句柄
   第2个参数为从机设备地址
   第3个参数为从机寄存器地址
   第4个参数为从机寄存器地址长度
   第5个参数为发送的数据的起始地址
   第6个参数为传输数据的大小
   第7个参数为操作超时时间 　　*/

```

Function: IIC write multiple data This function is suitable for devices with sub-address registers in the IIC peripheral, such as E2PROM. In addition to the device address, each storage byte has its corresponding address

parameter:

- hi2c: I2C device number pointer, set which IIC is used. Example: &hi2c2
- DevAddress: slave device address, IIC address of slave device, for example, E2PROM device address 0xA0

- MemAddress: slave register address. Each time a byte of data is written, the address will automatically increase by 1.

- MemAddSize: Slave register address byte length 8 bits or 16 bits

- Is the byte type of the written data 8 bits or 16 bits?
  I2C_MEMADD_SIZE_8BIT
  I2C_MEMADD_SIZE_16BIT
  It is defined in stm32f1xx_hal_i2c.h

* pData: the starting address of the data to be written

- Size: The size of the transmitted data in bytes

- Timeout: The maximum reading time . If the time is exceeded, the function will automatically exit.
  


Using HAL_I2C_Mem_Write is equivalent to using HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit to transmit the first register address first , and then using HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit to transmit the data written to the first register. Multiple data can be transmitted

```c
void Single_WriteI2C(uint8_t REG_Address,uint8_t REG_data)
{
    uint8_t TxData[2] = {REG_Address,REG_data};
    while(HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit(&hi2c1,I2C1_WRITE_ADDRESS,(uint8_t*)TxData,2,1000) != HAL_OK)
    {
        if (HAL_I2C_GetError(&hi2c1) != HAL_I2C_ERROR_AF)
                {
                  Error_Handler();
                }
    }
}
```



## Hardware IIC reads AT24C02

Declare at the beginning of **the main.c file the AT24C02 write address and read address, define the write data array, and the read data array**

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */
#include <string.h>

#define ADDR_24LCxx_Write 0xA0
#define ADDR_24LCxx_Read 0xA1
#define BufferSize 256
uint8_t WriteBuffer[BufferSize],ReadBuffer[BufferSize];
uint16_t i;
/* USER CODE END PV */
```

**Redefine the printf function**

\#include <stdio.h> in **stm32f4xx_hal.c**

```c
#include "stm32f4xx_hal.h"
#include <stdio.h>
extern UART_HandleTypeDef huart1;   //声明串口
```

Rewrite fget and fput functions in **stm32f4xx_hal.c**

```c
/**
  * 函数功能: 重定向c库函数printf到DEBUG_USARTx
  * 输入参数: 无
  * 返 回 值: 无
  * 说    明：无
  */
int fputc(int ch, FILE *f)
{
  HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, (uint8_t *)&ch, 1, 0xffff);
  return ch;
}

/**
  * 函数功能: 重定向c库函数getchar,scanf到DEBUG_USARTx
  * 输入参数: 无
  * 返 回 值: 无
  * 说    明：无
  */
int fgetc(FILE *f)
{
  uint8_t ch = 0;
  HAL_UART_Receive(&huart1, &ch, 1, 0xffff);
  return ch;
}
```

Add in **main.c**

```c
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
	for(i=0; i<256; i++)
    WriteBuffer[i]=i;    /* WriteBuffer init */


		printf("\r\n***************I2C Example Z小旋测试*******************************\r\n");
			for (int j=0; j<32; j++)
        {
                if(HAL_I2C_Mem_Write(&hi2c1, ADDR_24LCxx_Write, 8*j, I2C_MEMADD_SIZE_8BIT,WriteBuffer+8*j,8, 1000) == HAL_OK)
                {
                                printf("\r\n EEPROM 24C02 Write Test OK \r\n");
                        HAL_Delay(20);
                }
                else
                {
                         HAL_Delay(20);
                                printf("\r\n EEPROM 24C02 Write Test False \r\n");
                }
		}
		/*
		// wrinte date to EEPROM   如果要一次写一个字节，写256次，用这里的代码
		for(i=0;i<BufferSize;i++)
		{
		    HAL_I2C_Mem_Write(&hi2c1, ADDR_24LCxx_Write, i, I2C_MEMADD_SIZE_8BIT,&WriteBuffer[i],1，0xff);//使用I2C块读，出错。因此采用此种方式，逐个单字节写入
		  HAL_Delay(5);//此处延时必加，与AT24C02写时序有关
		}
		printf("\r\n EEPROM 24C02 Write Test OK \r\n");
		*/

		HAL_I2C_Mem_Read(&hi2c1, ADDR_24LCxx_Read, 0, I2C_MEMADD_SIZE_8BIT,ReadBuffer,BufferSize, 0xff);

		for(i=0; i<256; i++)
			printf("0x%02X  ",ReadBuffer[i]);
			
  /* USER CODE END 2 */

```

**Precautions:**

- The IIC of AT24C02 needs to delay for a period of time after each write before continuing to write. It takes about 5ms to delay after each write . No matter what form of hardware IIC is used (DMA, IT), it is necessary to ensure that the interval between two writes is greater than 5ms;

- The last timeout of the read and write function is adjusted to more than 1000 because we write 8 bytes at a time, so the delay is longer.
- AT24C02 page write only supports 8 bytes, so it needs to be written in 32 times. This is not a bug of the HAL library, but a limitation of AT24C02. Other EEPROMs can support more bytes of writing.

Of course, you can also write one byte at a time and divide it into 256 writes, which is also possible. Then just use the commented code
