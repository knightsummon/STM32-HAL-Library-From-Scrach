## DAC

The abbreviation of Digital-to-Analog Converter. Digital-to-analog converter . Also known as D/A converter, or DAC for short, is a device that converts discrete digital signals into continuous variable analog signals .

A typical digital-to-analog converter converts a digital signal representing a proportional voltage value into an analog signal .

There are two DACs in the STM32F1, which can be used simultaneously. The DAC module of the STM32 is a 12-bit digital input, voltage output DAC.

**DAC has two purposes: output waveform and output fixed voltage**

### How DACs work

![01](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/01.jpg)

Here we divide it into three parts:

**"Trigger mode" "Control logic" "Digital to analog converter"**

**1Trigger method**
The first part, trigger mode, means that the DAC conversion can be triggered by an external event (timer counter, external interrupt line). The configuration control bit TSELx [2:0] can select one of the 8 trigger events to trigger the DAC conversion. Any trigger source can trigger the DAC conversion.

The specific external trigger can be seen in the figure below:
![02](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/02.jpg)

Six are timer triggers: TIM2, TIM4, TIM5, TIM6, TIM7 and TIM8. The remaining two are: EXTI line 9 (PC9) and software trigger

**Each time the DAC interface detects a rising edge from the selected timer TRGO output or external interrupt line 9 , the data currently stored in the DAC_DHRx register will be transferred to the DAC_DORx register . After 3 APB1 clock cycles , the DAC_DORx register is updated with the new value.**

If software trigger is selected, the conversion starts once the SWTRIG bit is set to '1'. After the data is transferred from the DAC_DHRx register to the DAC_DORx register, the SWTRIG bit is automatically cleared to '0' by hardware.

**2 Control Logic**
This part determines the DAC waveform control, output mode, DMA transmission, etc.

Let's explain it in detail.
From the block diagram, we can see that the DAC is directly controlled by the DORx register , but
the data is not directly transferred to DORx. It needs to be transferred to DHRx first and then indirectly transferred to the DORx register. Data cannot be written directly to the DORx register.

If hardware trigger is not selected (TENx=0), DORx is passed in after one APB1 cycle.
If hardware trigger is selected (TENx=1), DORx is input after 3 APB1 cycles.
Once the data is loaded from the DAC_DHRx register into the DAC_DORx register, the output is valid after a time Tsetting (approximately 3us). The length of this time varies depending on the power supply voltage and analog output load.

- If hardware trigger is not selected (TENx=0), DORx is passed in after one APB1 cycle.

- If hardware trigger is selected (TENx=1), DORx is input after 3 APB1 cycles.

The DMAENx TENx MAMOx[3:0], WAVENx[1:0] bits in the above figure are all controlled by the DAC_CR register.

DMAENx controls DMA enable of DAC channel 1/2

**MAMP2[3:0]**: DAC channel 2 mask/amplitude selector bits 27:24 These bits are set by software
to select the mask bits in noise generation mode and the amplitude of the waveform in triangle wave generation mode .

**WAVE2[1:0]**: DAC channel 2 noise/triangle wave generation enable

Position 23:22

Determines whether to generate a waveform and what waveform to generate.
00: Disable the waveform generator;
10: Enable the noise waveform generator;
1x: Enable the triangle wave generator.

**TENx**: DAC channel x trigger enable, used to enable/disable the trigger of DAC channel x.

0: Disable DAC channel x trigger, data written to DAC_DHRx register will be transferred to DAC_DORx register after 1 APB1 clock cycle;
1: Enable DAC channel x trigger, data written to DAC_DHRx register will be transferred to DAC_DORx register after 3 APB1 clock cycles.
Note: If software trigger is selected, data written to register DAC_DHRx will be transferred to register DAC_DORx in only 1 APB1 clock cycle.



#### **3. Digital to Analog Converter**

![05](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/05.jpg)

VDDA and VSSA are the power supplies for the analog part of the DAC module.
Vref+ is the reference voltage of the DAC module.
DAC_OUTx is the output channel of the DAC (corresponding to the PA4 or PA5 pin)

**From the left reference voltage Vref+ ----> DAC ----> analog signal output pin**

![06](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/06.jpg)

Note: The DAC pin should be set to analog input (AIN) mode

DAC output voltage:

The digital input is linearly converted to an analog voltage output by the DAC.

Its range is 0~VREF+

DAC output = VREF x (DOR/4095)

Special functions:
noise waveform generation, triangle waveform generation, external trigger conversion, dual DAC simultaneous or separate conversion; each channel has DMA function;

Reference voltage: 2.4V~3.3V


**Key Features of DACs**

- 2 DAC converters:
- Each converter corresponds to 1 output channel;
- 8-bit or 12-bit monotone output;
- In 12-bit mode, data is left-aligned or right-aligned;
- Synchronous update function;
- Noise waveform generation;
- Triangular waveform generation;
- Dual DAC channels convert simultaneously or separately;
- External trigger conversion;
- Input reference voltage VREF+.

**DAC Principle Overview**
The digital/analog converter module (DAC) is a 12-bit digital input, voltage output digital/analog converter . The DAC can be configured in 8-bit or 12-bit mode, and can also be used in conjunction with a DMA controller. When the DAC works in 12-bit mode, the data can be set to left-aligned or right-aligned . The DAC module has 2 output channels , each with a separate converter. In dual DAC mode, the 2 channels can be converted independently, or they can be converted simultaneously and the outputs of the 2 channels can be updated synchronously. The DAC can input a reference voltage VREF+ through the pin to obtain a more accurate conversion result.

**3DAC Settings**

![07](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/07.jpg)

1. OUT1 and OUT2 correspond to two output channels

2. External Trigger External interrupt EXTI9 trigger

Is to use external interrupt to trigger ADC

3. Tigger Select the triggering method of DAC. All are explained above.

Output Buffer enables DAC output buffer

The DAC integrates two output buffers, which can be used to reduce the output impedance and directly drive the external load without an external op amp. Each DAC channel output buffer can be enabled or disabled by setting the **BOFFx** bit in the DAC_CR register.

## Detailed explanation of the routine:

**DAC library functions:**

```c

/* IO operation functions *****************************************************/
HAL_StatusTypeDef HAL_DAC_Start(DAC_HandleTypeDef* hdac, uint32_t Channel);     //开启DAC输出
HAL_StatusTypeDef HAL_DAC_Stop(DAC_HandleTypeDef* hdac, uint32_t Channel);   //关闭DAC输出
HAL_StatusTypeDef HAL_DAC_Start_DMA(DAC_HandleTypeDef* hdac, uint32_t Channel, uint32_t* pData, uint32_t Length, uint32_t Alignment); //需要函数中不断开启   //开启DAC的DMA输出
HAL_StatusTypeDef HAL_DAC_Stop_DMA(DAC_HandleTypeDef* hdac, uint32_t Channel); //关闭DAC的DMA输出
HAL_StatusTypeDef HAL_DAC_SetValue(DAC_HandleTypeDef* hdac, uint32_t Channel, uint32_t Alignment, uint32_t Data);  //设置DAC输出值
uint32_t HAL_DAC_GetValue(DAC_HandleTypeDef* hdac, uint32_t Channel);  //获取DAC输出值
```

**DAC output voltage:**
In the main() function, set the DAC output data to 12 bits right-aligned, the DAC output to 2048, and enable the DAC1 output channel

```c
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
  HAL_DAC_SetValue(&hdac, DAC_CHANNEL_1, DAC_ALIGN_12B_R, 2048);

	HAL_DAC_Start(&hdac,DAC_CHANNEL_1);
  /* USER CODE END 2 */
```

**DAC output = VREF x (DOR/4095)**

The actual output voltage is
2048/4096x3.3V=1.65V.

In this context, "stable" means that when the DAC is set to a certain digital input value (in this case, 2048 out of a possible 0 to 4095), it consistently produces a specific analog voltage level (1.65V) corresponding to that input value. This voltage level remains constant as long as the DAC settings and the input value remain unchanged.

![08](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/08.jpg)

**HAL_DAC_SetValue(&hdac, DAC_CHANNEL_1, DAC_ALIGN_12B_R, 2048);**

Parameter 1: DAC structure name
Parameter 2: Set the DAC channel
Parameter 3: Set the DAC alignment
Parameter 4: Set the output voltage value 12 bits, maximum bit 4095

**HAL_DAC_Start(&hdac,DAC_CHANNEL_1);**
Function: Enable DAC output
Parameter 1: DAC structure name
Parameter 2: DAC channel



# DAC Output Waveform

![09](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/09.jpg)

to enable DAC output channel 2.

DAC external trigger (Trigger) : Timer 2 trigger,

Wave generation mode : Triangle wave generation.

You can choose triangle waveform and noise waveform (noise wave generation)

Maximum Triangle Amplitude: 4095 ,

Assume the triangle wave amplitude is 3.3V, that is 4095

DAC 12-bit data storage, maximum 4095

0-4095 corresponds to 0V~3.3V

Turn on Timers and enable timer 2
![10](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/10.jpg)

The configuration is as follows. The specific configuration principle has been explained in the previous
[STM32] HAL library STM32CubeMX tutorial 6 ---- timer interrupt
. I will not elaborate on it here. Just follow the diagram to configure it.

Here is the frequency of the triangle wave

It is possible to add a small-amplitude triangular waveform on a DC or slowly varying signal. DAC triangle-wave generation is selected by setting WAVEx[1:0] to “10”. The amplitude is configured through the MAMPx[3:0] bits in the DAC_CR register. An internal triangle counter is incremented three APB1 clock cycles after each trigger event. The value of this counter is then added to the DAC_DHRx register without overflow and the sum is stored into the DAC_DORx register. The triangle counter is incremented as long as it is less than the maximum amplitude defined by the MAMPx[3:0] bits. Once the configured amplitude is reached, the counter is decremented down to 0, then incremented again and so on.

![11](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/11.jpg)

![12](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/10.%20HAL%20Library%20DAC.assets/12.jpg)

Triangle wave frequency:

Assume the amplitude of the triangle wave is 3.3V, which is 4095. Therefore, one cycle counter counts 4096*2=8192 times, and the frequency of the triangle wave is " timer frequency/8192 " .

### code:

Add the following two lines of code in the main function to **output a triangular wave**

```c
    /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
     HAL_TIM_Base_Start(&htim2);
     HAL_DAC_Start(&hdac, DAC_CHANNEL_2);
     /* USER CODE END 2 */
```

**Turn on timer TIM2 and turn on DAC** respectively
