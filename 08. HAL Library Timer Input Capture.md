## Input Capture

Input Capture Concept
Input capture mode can be used to measure pulse width or frequency. Except for TIM6 and TIM7, all other timers of STM32 have input capture function.

For details, please refer to "[STM32] HAL Library STM32CubeMX Tutorial 6 - Timer Interrupt"

### How Input Capture Works

![01](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/08.%20HAL%20Library%20Timer%20Input%20Capture.assets/01.jpg)

①First set the input capture to rising edge detection,

②Record the value of TIMx_CNT (counter) when the rising edge occurs

③Configure the capture signal to capture on the falling edge, and capture occurs when the falling edge arrives

④Record the value of TIMx_CNT(counter)  at this time

⑤The difference between the two TIMx_CNT (counter) values is the high level pulse width. At the same time, according to the TIM counting frequency, we can know the exact time of the high level pulse width.

When you set the capture to start, the CPU will copy the value of the **count register** to the **capture compare register** and start counting. When the level change is captured again, the value in the count register minus the value just copied is the duration of this level. You can set the rising edge capture, the falling edge capture, or both the rising and falling edges .

## Input capture workflow (corresponding to the four options of CubeMx)

### Setting the input capture filter

STM32 provides filters in many functions. The function of the filter is simply to regard multiple detections as valid once to achieve the filtering effect.

The digital filter consists of an event counter. Assuming that we detect high level and filter N times, the counter will generate an output jump after recording N events. In other words, if the N consecutive sampling detections are all high level, it means that this is a valid level signal, so that some signals generated by interference can be filtered out.        

Input capture filter IC1F[3:0], which is used to set the sampling frequency and digital filter length . Among them: fCK_INT is the input frequency of the timer, and fDTS is determined by the setting of CKD[1:0] of TIMx_CR1.

### Set input capture polarity

Set the specific capture event

You can set the rising edge capture, falling edge capture, or both rising and falling edges to capture.



## Overflow time calculation:

![03](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/08.%20HAL%20Library%20Timer%20Input%20Capture.assets/03.jpg)

At time t1, a high level is detected and **an interrupt occurs**. In the interrupt, the count value is set to 0 and the overflow times N are counted.

The overflow occurs every time when the count is 0xFFFF, until it jumps back to low level at t2.

Get the count value **TIM5CH1_CAPTURE_VAL** from the last overflow to time t2

Then   the **high level time = overflow times * 65535(0xFFFF) + TIM5CH1_CAPTURE_VAL** us  ; according to the frequency when the timer is initialized, the time occupied by the total number of overflow times can be calculated, which is the high level time.

If the counter value is 32 bits   , the maximum value is 0xFFFFFFFF

**3. Timer Configuration**

![04](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/08.%20HAL%20Library%20Timer%20Input%20Capture.assets/04.jpg)

Here we select channel 1 of TIM5

The pre-scaling factor is 71. The counting clock frequency is 72MHz/(71+1) = 1MHz. At this time, 1us counts once.
The auto-load value is set to the 32-bit maximum value 0xFFFFFFFF          
Rising edge capture
No frequency division
The filter value is 8
At the same time, enable the TIM5 interrupt in the NVIC column

Set a pull-down resistor on the corresponding pin to ensure that the level is stable when there is no signal input

## Routine implementation:

### Define variables:

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */
    uint32_t capture_Buf[3] = {0};   //存放计数值
    uint8_t capture_Cnt = 0;    //状态标志位
    uint32_t high_time;   //高电平时间
/* USER CODE END 0 */
```

### In user code area 3 in while(1), write the input capture control and data processing of TIM5CH1 channel

```c
while (1)
{
    /* USER CODE END WHILE */
 
    /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
  switch (capture_Cnt){
          
	case 0:
		capture_Cnt++;
		__HAL_TIM_SET_CAPTUREPOLARITY(&htim5, TIM_CHANNEL_1, TIM_INPUTCHANNELPOLARITY_RISING);
		HAL_TIM_IC_Start_IT(&htim5, TIM_CHANNEL_1);	//启动输入捕获       或者: __HAL_TIM_ENABLE(&htim5);
		break;
          /*
          If capture_Cnt is equal to 0, then these statements will be executed. capture_Cnt is then incremented by
          one. __HAL_TIM_SET_CAPTUREPOLARITY sets the polarity of the input capture. In this case, it's set to
          rising edge. HAL_TIM_IC_Start_IT starts input capture interrupts for Timer 5 on channel 1.
          */
          
	case 3: //Case 3: This case handles the situation where the input capture process has captured the signal twice (typically, this would be a rising edge detected twice).
		high_time = capture_Buf[1]- capture_Buf[0];    //高电平时间
		HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, (uint8_t *)high_time, 1, 0xffff);   //发送高电平时间
		/*
		If capture_Cnt is equal to 3, then these statements will be executed. It calculates the
		duration of the high signal by subtracting the first captured time from the second captured
		time and stores it in high_time. It then transmits this value via UART. After a delay of 1
		second using HAL_Delay, capture_Cnt is reset to 0.
		*/		
				
		HAL_Delay(1000);   //延时1S
		capture_Cnt = 0;  //清空标志位
		break;
				
	}
}
/* USER CODE END 3 */
```

Add the interrupt callback function below the main function:

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN 4 */
void HAL_TIM_IC_CaptureCallback(TIM_HandleTypeDef *htim)
{
	
	if(TIM5 == htim->Instance)
	{
		switch(capture_Cnt){
			case 1:
				capture_Buf[0] = HAL_TIM_ReadCapturedValue(&htim5,TIM_CHANNEL_1);//获取当前的捕获值.
				__HAL_TIM_SET_CAPTUREPOLARITY(&htim5,TIM_CHANNEL_1,TIM_ICPOLARITY_FALLING);  //改默认的上升捕获为下降沿捕获
				capture_Cnt++;
				break;
			case 2:
				capture_Buf[1] = HAL_TIM_ReadCapturedValue(&htim5,TIM_CHANNEL_1);//获取当前的捕获值.
				HAL_TIM_IC_Stop_IT(&htim5,TIM_CHANNEL_1); //停止捕获   或者: __HAL_TIM_DISABLE(&htim5);
				capture_Cnt++;    
		}
	
	}
	
}
/* USER CODE END 4 */
```

specific process:

1. Set TIM5 CH1 to input capture function;  

2. Set rising edge capture; 

3. Enable TIM2 CH1 capture function;  

4. After capturing the rising edge, the current count value of the timer is stored in capture_buf[0], and the falling edge is captured instead;   

 5. After capturing the falling edge, the current count value of the timer is stored in capture_buf[1], and the TIM2 CH1 capture function is turned off; capture_Cnt=3;

6. High level time: capture_buf[1] - capture_buf[0] is sent to the host computer to restart input capture

__HAL_TIM_SET_COUNTER(&TIM5_Handler,0);    //Set the value of the counter register to 0

The HAL_TIM_PWM_Start () function is used to enable the PWM output of a channel of the timer.

The HAL_TIM_IC_Start_IT () function is used to enable the input capture function of a channel of the timer and enable the corresponding interrupt

The HAL_TIM_IC_Stop_IT () function is the opposite of the start function, which turns off the input capture function and corresponding interrupt of a channel of the timer


There are two functions, the first one is to clear **the original capture polarity** , and the second one is to set **the channel capture polarity**

**Equivalent to:**

```c
TIM_RESET_CAPTUREPOLARITY(&TIM5_Handler,TIM_CHANNEL_1);   //一定要先清除原来的捕获极性！！
TIM_SET_CAPTUREPOLARITY(&TIM5_Handler,TIM_CHANNEL_1,TIM_ICPOLARITY_FALLING);//定时器5通道1设置为下降沿捕获（重设捕获极性）
```

__HAL_TIM_GET_COMPARE is also a macro definition. 
It can be found in the stm32f4xx_hal_tim.h file. Its function is to get the capture/compare register value of a channel of the timer.
![07](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/08.%20HAL%20Library%20Timer%20Input%20Capture.assets/07.jpg)

**Equivalent to: HAL_TIM_ReadCapturedValue(&htim5,TIM_CHANNEL_1);**

 Both directly read the value of the corresponding CCRx register

## Why when the Timer capture the input, we should allocate it an interruption?

**Efficiency:** Without interrupts, the microcontroller would need to continuously poll the timer's status register to check if a capture event has occurred. This constant polling consumes CPU cycles, leading to inefficiency. By using interrupts, the microcontroller can perform other tasks while waiting for a capture event. When a capture event occurs, the interrupt service routine (ISR) is executed, allowing the microcontroller to respond immediately without wasting CPU cycles on polling.
