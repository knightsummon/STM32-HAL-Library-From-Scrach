### What is PWM

 Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), short for "Pulse Width Modulation" , is a very effective technology that uses the digital output of a microprocessor to control analog circuits. It is widely used in many fields from measurement, communication to power control and conversion.

 

### How PWM works

The SMT32F1 series has a total of 8 timers:

Advanced timers (TIM1, TIM8); general timers (TIM2, TIM3, TIM4, TIM5); basic timers (TIM6, TIM7).

The SMT32F4 series has a total of 15 timers:

Advanced timers (TIM1, TIM8); general timers (TIM2, TIM3, TIM4, TIM5, TIM9~TIM14); basic timers (TIM6, TIM7).

 

**Each general-purpose timer of STM32 has 4 independent channels that can be used as: input capture, output comparison, PWM output, single pulse mode output, etc.**

Except for TIM6 and TIM7 (basic timers), all other timers of STM32 can generate PWM output. Among them, advanced timers TIM1 and TIM8 can generate 7 PWM outputs at the same time.

Principle explanation:

The following figure shows the up counting mode:

- In PWM output mode, in addition to CNT (counter current value) and ARR (auto-reload value), there is an additional value CCRx (capture/compare register value).

- When CNT is less than CCRx, the TIMx_CHx channel outputs a low level;
- When CNT is equal to or greater than CCRx, the TIMx_CHx channel outputs a high level.

### One cycle of PWM

    The timer starts counting up from 0.
    When the timer counter TIMx_CNT value is less than the CCRx value during the 0-t1 period, the output is low level.
    During the period t1-t2, the timer counter TIMx_CNT value is greater than the CCRx value, and the output is high level.
    When the TIMx_CNT value reaches ARR, the timer overflows and counts up again... This process repeats
    At this point, a PWM cycle is completed.
### Summarize:

Each timer has four channels, each channel has a capture compare register. 

Compare the register value with the counter value, and output high and low levels through the comparison result to achieve pulse width modulation mode (PWM signal)

**The TIMx_ARR register determines the PWM frequency,**

**The TIMx_CCRx register determines the duty cycle**

**If you are a beginner, you can generally understand it by looking at the red fonts.**

**PWM working mode:**
PWM mode 1 (up counting): The counter counts from 0 to the auto-reload value (TIMx_ARR) , then starts counting from 0 again and generates a counter overflow event   
PWM mode 2 (down counting): The counter decreases from the auto-reload value (TIMx_ARR) to 0 , then starts to decrease from the reload value (TIMx_ARR) again, and generates a counter overflow event   
Set the OC1M[2:0] bit of the TIMx_CCMR1 register to determine the PWM output mode:

PWM mode 1: When counting up, once TIMx_CNT<TIMx_CCR1, channel 1 is at a valid level, otherwise it is at an invalid level ; when counting down, once TIMx_CNT>TIMx_CCR1, channel 1 is at an invalid level (OC1REF=0), otherwise it is at a valid level (OC1REF=1).
PWM mode 2: When counting up, once TIMx_CNT<TIMx_CCR1, channel 1 is at an invalid level, otherwise it is at a valid level; when counting down, once TIMx_CNT>TIMx_CCR1, channel 1 is at a valid level, otherwise it is at an invalid level.

### Working process of PWM

![02](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/007.%20PWM%20Output%20Breathing%20Light.assets/02.jpg)

1. CCR1 register: capture/compare value register: set the compare value;

The counter value TIMx_CNT is compared with the channel 1 capture compare register CCR1, and the valid level and invalid level are output through the comparison result.    

OC1REF=0 Invalid level    
OC1REF=1 Invalid level
2. TIMx_CCMR1 register: OC1M[2:0] bit: used to set PWM mode

110: PWM mode 1
111: PWM mode 2
3. CCER register: CC1P bit: Input/capture 1 output polarity.

 0: High level is effective level     
1: Low level is effective level

4. CCER register: CC1E bit: Input/capture 1 output enable.

0: Disable enable
1: Enable

n the Parameter Settings page, configure the pre-scaling factor to 71, the count period (auto-load value) to 499, and the timer overflow frequency, i.e. the PWM period, to be 72MHz/(71+1)/(499+1) = 2kHz.

PWM frequency:

Fpwm = Tclk / ((arr+1)*(psc+1)) (unit: Hz)

arr is the counter value
psc is the prescaler value
Duty Cycle:

duty circle = TIM3->CCR1 / arr (unit: %)
TIM3->CCR1 user setting value
For example, the timer frequency Tclk  = 72Mhz arr=499 psc=71, then the PWM frequency is 720000/500/72= 2000Hz, or 2KHz

arr=499,TIM3->CCR1=250, then the duty cycle of pwm is 50%

## User Code

**Define variables:**

```c
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */
    uint16_t pwmVal=0;   //PWM占空比  
    uint8_t dir=1;    
  /* USER CODE END 1 */
```

**Then enable the PWM Channel1 output of TIM3.**

```c
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
  HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(&htim3,TIM_CHANNEL_1);
  /* USER CODE END 2 */
```

**Add the following code inside the while loop:**

```c
  while (1)
  {
  /* USER CODE END WHILE */
 
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
 
	  while (pwmVal< 500)
	  {
		  pwmVal++;
		  __HAL_TIM_SetCompare(&htim3, TIM_CHANNEL_1, pwmVal);    //修改比较值，修改占空比
//		  TIM3->CCR1 = pwmVal;    与上方相同
		  HAL_Delay(1);
	  }
	  while (pwmVal)
	  {
		  pwmVal--;
		  __HAL_TIM_SetCompare(&htim3, TIM_CHANNEL_1, pwmVal);    //修改比较值，修改占空比
//		  TIM3->CCR1 = pwmVal;     与上方相同
		  HAL_Delay(1);
	  }
	  HAL_Delay(200);
 
  /* USER CODE END 3 */
 }
```

### Explanation:

```c
uint16_t pwmVal=0;   //PWM占空比  
uint8_t dir=1;
```

- `uint16_t pwmVal=0;`: This line declares a variable named `pwmVal` of type `uint16_t` (unsigned 16-bit integer) and initializes it to 0. This variable will hold the current PWM duty cycle value.
- `uint8_t dir=1;`: This line declares a variable named `dir` of type `uint8_t` (unsigned 8-bit integer) and initializes it to 1. This variable is used to control the direction of the PWM change.

```c
HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(&htim3,TIM_CHANNEL_1);
```

- `HAL_TIM_PWM_Start(&htim3,TIM_CHANNEL_1);`: This line starts PWM signal generation on Timer 3, Channel 1. It initializes the hardware timer to generate PWM signals.

```c
codewhile (1)
{
```

- `while (1)`: This starts an infinite loop, meaning the code inside it will keep executing indefinitely.

```c
while (pwmVal< 500)
{
    pwmVal++;
    __HAL_TIM_SetCompare(&htim3, TIM_CHANNEL_1, pwmVal);
    HAL_Delay(1);
}
```

- `while (pwmVal< 500)`: This starts a nested while loop. It will execute as long as the `pwmVal` variable is less than 500.
- `pwmVal++;`: This line increments the `pwmVal` variable by 1 in each iteration, gradually increasing the PWM duty cycle.
- `__HAL_TIM_SetCompare(&htim3, TIM_CHANNEL_1, pwmVal);`: This line sets the PWM duty cycle value to `pwmVal`, effectively controlling the brightness of the LED.
- `HAL_Delay(1);`: This line introduces a 1 millisecond delay between each increment of the PWM duty cycle.

```c
while (pwmVal)
{
    pwmVal--;
    __HAL_TIM_SetCompare(&htim3, TIM_CHANNEL_1, pwmVal);
    HAL_Delay(1);
}
```

- This part is similar to the previous while loop, but it decreases the `pwmVal` variable from its maximum value back to 0. This effectively decreases the brightness of the LED.

```c
HAL_Delay(200);
```

- `HAL_Delay(200);`: After completing a cycle of increasing and decreasing the PWM duty cycle, this line introduces a delay of 200 milliseconds before starting the next cycle. This controls the overall speed of the breathing effect.

It can be seen that the breathing light is accumulated from multiple different differential signals.
