### What is ADC

The abbreviation of Analog-to-Digital Converter. **It refers to an analog/digital converter or an analog/digital converter. It refers to a device that converts a continuous variable analog signal into a discrete digital signal .**

A typical analog-to-digital converter converts an analog signal into a digital signal that represents a proportional voltage value.

Simply put, it converts the analog voltage value into the corresponding value readable by the naked eye.

The 12-bit ADC is a successive approximation analog-to-digital converter. It has 3 ADC controllers , up to 18 channels , and can measure 16 external and 2 internal signal sources. The A/D conversion of each channel can be performed in single, continuous, scan or intermittent mode . The result of the ADC can be stored in a 16-bit data register in left-aligned or right-aligned mode .

12-bit analog-to-digital converter
That is, the digital storage of ADC is 12 bits, which means that the maximum value obtained by the converter through acquisition conversion is 4095. "1111111111111" = 4095. The 12 bits of binary can represent the number 0-4095, which corresponds to the actual value of the measured voltage. If the converted voltage range is 0v-3.3v, the converter will divide 0v-3.3v into 4096 parts. Let the value obtained by the converter be x, and the required voltage value be y.

#### **3 ADC controllers**

That is to say, **STM32 has a total of 3 ADCs** ADC1, ADC2, ADC3

### 18 channels

The STM32 ADC has up to 18 channels,
16 external channels and 2 internal signal sources. You can find out which IO port it is from the manual.

The corresponding relationship between ADC channels and pins of STM32F40x series chips is as follows:


![03](09. HAL Library ADC.assets/03.jpg)

16 external channels : There are 16 pins on the chip that can be connected to analog voltage for voltage value detection.

2 internal signal sources : one is the internal temperature sensor, the other is the internal reference voltage

A total of 23 pins support ADC, including 21 external and 2 internal signal sources



### ADC conversion mode (important, please make sure to understand)

1.Single conversion mode: Suppose you have a temperature sensor connected to channel 0 of the ADC. In single conversion mode, when you need to measure temperature, the ADC performs a conversion to get the data on channel 0, then stops converting until the next trigger.

2.Continuous Conversion Mode: Consider the same temperature sensor, but this time you set the ADC to continuous conversion mode. Once the conversion on channel 0 is completed, the ADC immediately starts the next conversion on the same channel, and so on, repeating the temperature measurement.

3.Scan Mode: Let's say you have four sensors connected to channels 0, 1, 4 and 5. In scan mode, the ADC will convert these four channels in sequence, starting from channel 0, then converting to channel 1, then channel 4, and finally channel 5. If continuous conversion mode is enabled, conversion will restart as soon as channel 5 is completed, continuing from channel 0.

4.Intermittent mode: Taking the same four sensors as an example, you can divide them into two groups: channel 0 and channel 1 are one group, and channel 4 and channel 5 are another group. In discontinuous mode, a trigger signal is required before each set of conversions. For example, a trigger signal initiates conversions on the first group (Channel 0 and Channel 1), then the second group (Channel 4 and Channel 5), and so on until all conversions are complete.

### Align left or right

Because the data obtained by the ADC is 12-bit accurate, but the data is stored in a 16-bit data register, the storage result of the ADC can be divided into left-aligned or right-aligned (12 bits)

#### 1 Voltage input range

![07](09. HAL Library ADC.assets/07.jpg)

ADC is generally used to collect small voltages, and its input value cannot exceed VDDA , that is, the ADC input range is: VREF- ≤ VIN ≤ VREF+. See the figure above for specific definitions.
Generally, VSSA and VREF- are grounded, VREF+ and VDDA are connected to 3V3, then the ADC input range is 0~3.3V

### 2 ADC input channels

ADCx_INT0-ADCx_INT15 correspond to the 16 external channels of the three ADCs for analog signal conversion . In addition, there are two internal channels: temperature detection or internal voltage detection.
After selecting the corresponding channel, the corresponding GPIO pin will be selected . The relevant pin definitions and descriptions can be found in the data sheet of the development board.

### 3 Injection channel, regular channel

We see that after selecting the relevant channel pin of the ADC, there are two channels in the analog-to-digital converter, the injection channel and
the regular channel. The regular channels can be up to 16 and the injection channels can be up to 4.

Rules channel:

The rule channel is equivalent to your normally running program. You can tell from its name that it is very regular, that is, the normal execution program
injection channel: the injection channel can interrupt the rule channel. You can tell from its name that it is restless. If there is an injection channel to convert during the rule channel conversion process , then you must convert the injection channel first, and then return to the rule channel conversion process after the injection channel conversion is completed.
![09](09. HAL Library ADC.assets/09.jpg)

### 4 ADC clock

The ADCCLK of the ADC prescaler in the figure is the clock source of the ADC module . Usually, the ADCCLK clock provided by the clock controller is synchronized with PCLK2 (APB2 clock). The RCC controller provides a dedicated programmable prescaler for the ADC clock. The division factor is configured by ADCPRE[1:0] of RCC_CFGR, which can be configured as 2/4/6/8 divisions.

The maximum conversion rate of STM32's ADC is 1MHz, which means the fastest conversion time is 1us. In order to ensure the accuracy of the ADC conversion results, the ADC clock should not exceed 14M.

```
T = sampling time + 12.5 cycles, where 1 cycle is 1/ADCCLK
```

For example, when ADCCLK=14Mhz, and set the sampling time to 1.5 cycles, we get: Tcovn=1.5+12.5=14 cycles=1us.

### 5 External trigger conversion

ADC conversion can be controlled by the ADON bit of ADC control register 2: ADC_CR2. Writing 1 starts the conversion and writing 0 stops the conversion.

Of course, in addition to the ADON bit of the ADC_CR2 register controlling the start and stop of the conversion, it can also support external event triggering conversion (such as timer capture, EXTI line)

Including internal timer trigger and external IO trigger . The specific trigger source is controlled by the EXTSEL[2:0] bit ( regular channel trigger source ) and JEXTSEL[2:0] bit ( injection channel trigger source ) of ADC_CR2.

At the same time, the trigger source of ADC3 is different from that of ADC1/2, as shown in the figure above.

Please refer to the block diagram in Part 5 for details.

### 6 Interrupt

There are three interrupt trigger conditions: the regular channel conversion ends , the injection channel conversion ends , or the analog watchdog status bit is set .

### DMA

At the same time, ADC also supports DMA triggering. After the conversion of the rules and injection channels is completed, a DMA request will be generated to transfer the converted data to the memory.

Note that only ADC1 and ADC3 can generate DMA requests.

Because it involves DMA transmission, we will not introduce it in detail here. DMA will be updated in the next few sections. Generally, we will enable DMA transmission when using ADC.

**Set the ADC pin.**

![10](09. HAL Library ADC.assets/10.jpg)

## Routine:

Add in main.c

```c
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 0 */
	uint16_t ADC_Value;
  /* USER CODE END 0 */
```

Add AD calibration function after ADC initialization

```c
  MX_ADC1_Init();
	HAL_ADCEx_Calibration_Start(&hadc1);    //AD校准
  MX_USART1_UART_Init();
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
```

Add the following to while:

```c
 HAL_ADC_Start(&hadc1);     //启动ADC转换
 HAL_ADC_PollForConversion(&hadc1, 50);   //等待转换完成，50为最大等待时间，单位为ms
 
 
 if(HAL_IS_BIT_SET(HAL_ADC_GetState(&hadc1), HAL_ADC_STATE_REG_EOC))
 {
  ADC_Value = HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hadc1);   //获取AD值

  printf("ADC1 Reading : %d \r\n",ADC_Value);
  printf("PA3 True Voltage value : %.4f \r\n",ADC_Value*3.3f/4096);
  printf("Z小旋测试\r\n");
}
HAL_Delay(1000);
```

![11](09. HAL Library ADC.assets/11.jpg)

**and interrupt reading:**

If the ADC conversion end interrupt is enabled and the timer interrupt is enabled, you can write:

```c
// adc.c
void HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback(TIM_HandleTypeDef *htim)    //定时器中断回调
{
    HAL_ADC_Start_IT(&hadc1); //定时器中断里面开启ADC中断转换，1ms开启一次采集    
}

void HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback(ADC_HandleTypeDef* hadc)    //ADC转换完成回调
{
    HAL_ADC_Stop_IT(&hadc1);    　　　　//关闭ADC
    HAL_TIM_Base_Stop_IT(&htim3);　　  //关闭定时器
    AD_Value=HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hadc1);　　//获取ADC转换的值

    printf("ADC1 Reading : %d \r\n",AD_Value);
    printf("%.4f V\r\n",(AD_Value*3.3/4096));　　　  //串口打印电压信息
    HAL_TIM_Base_Start_IT(&htim3); 　　　　  //开启定时器
