# 01. Install the STM32CubeMX



## Introduction to STM32CubeMX

STM32CubeMX is a graphical configuration tool for STM32 chips that STMicroelectronics has strongly recommended in recent years. Its purpose is to facilitate developers and allow users to use a graphical wizard to generate C initialization code, which can greatly reduce development work, time and cost and improve development efficiency. STM32CubeMX covers almost the entire series of STM32 chips.

You need three steps to install CubeMx IDE

- JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Java runtime environment A collection of environments necessary to run JAVA programs
- STM32CubeMX
- HAL library:  STM32 HAL firmware library Another set of libraries officially launched by ST

### Install JRE

Since the STM32CubeMX software runs in the JAVA environment, you need to install JRE (Java Runtime Environment ) to use it.    Remember to choose the 64-bit installation.

## HAL library Installation

What is the HAL firmware library?

STM32 HAL firmware library is the abbreviation of Hardware Abstraction Layer, and its Chinese name is: Hardware Abstraction Layer. HAL library is the latest abstraction layer embedded software launched by ST for STM32 MCU, which is more convenient to achieve maximum portability across STM32 products. With the launch of HAL library, it can be said that ST has gradually abandoned the original standard firmware library, which has also made many old users dissatisfied. However, at the same time as the launch of HAL library, a lot of third-party middleware has also been added, including RTOS, USB, TCP/IP and graphics, etc.

Compared with the standard library, the STM32 HAL library is more abstract. ST's ultimate goal is to achieve seamless migration between STM32 series MCUs, and even fast migration to other MCUs.

And since 2016, ST has gradually stopped updating the standard firmware library and turned to updating the HAL firmware library and Low-layer underlying library. Stopping the standard library update means that using STM32CubeMX to configure the HAL/LL library will be the mainstream configuration environment in the future.

**There are two ways to install** the HAL library: online and offline 



### Online Installation

### Offline Installation

Offline installation requires downloading the installation package. Baidu Cloud and ST official download methods are provided here.           PS: Online installation is recommended for fast and stable installation

Official website: https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages/products.html

The column next to the software download is the HAL library download. Download the installation package for the corresponding chip

1.Import the installation package directly Help -> Manage embedded software packages -> From Local Select the offline package

2.Decompress directly

Help->Updater Settings... You can select the HAL library installation package path . The default path is in the C drive and can be modified by yourself.
