# 02. Light up LED



## What We Need

1. STM32 hardware (mine are STM32F407ZE and STM32F103ZE)
2. STM32CubeMx software, IDE Keil (MDK-ARM) software
3. STM32F4xx [HAL library](https://so.csdn.net/so/search?q=HALåº“&spm=1001.2101.3001.7020) 

## New Construction

1. Select File-->New Project on the main interface or directly click **ACCEE TO MCU SELECTOR**

When the chip model selection appears,  we can directly search for the model of our own chip.   

 If you are designing a product and want to choose a chip, you can find various search methods below the search bar. You can select chip core, model, etc. to help you find the right chip.

Specific process 1:

1. Search chip model

2. Select chip

3. Create a project

Then the next step is the highlight of our entire process.

**1 MCU peripheral resource selection**

**2 Peripheral Configuration**

Here you can set various functions of the peripherals you choose

Here we take serial port 1 as an example. We can select the serial port mode (asynchronous, synchronous, half-duplex), serial port receive interrupt, and serial port DMA transfer, etc.

**3 Preview interface**

![04](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/04.jpg)

Here are **pin preview** and **system preview**

**Pin preview allows you to view the function of the pin and the location of each pin.**

![06](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/06.jpg)

This color indicates **non-configurable pins.** Power-only pins are highlighted in yellow. Their configuration **cannot be changed.**

![07](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/07.jpg)

This color indicates that you have configured an I/O port function, but have not initialized the corresponding peripheral function. The pin is in no mode.

 Green means the configuration is successful

Set the corresponding pin of our **LED to GPIO_Output**

## Clock Source Settings

![10](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/10.jpg)

In fact, **the clock tree diagram of 32** allows you to configure the default clock to use the internal RC oscillator (HSI) 

**You need to configure RCC to use an external clock source**

#### **Engineering Project Management**

Here are the various configurations of the project. We only use a limited number of them, and the others are the default. The IDE we use is MDK5

The storage directory cannot contain Chinese characters
Then click Code Generator for further configuration ( important )

![13](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/13.jpg)

![14](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/14.jpg)

Copy all .C and .H of the HAL library to the built project 

Advantages: This will be very convenient if you need to add other peripherals later and may no longer use STM32CubeMX

Disadvantages: Large size, long compilation time (very long)  

![15](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/15.jpg)

Copy only the .C and .H files you need ( recommended )

Advantages: relatively small size, short compilation time, and the project can be copied

Disadvantages: When adding new peripherals, you need to re-import them using STM32CubeMX  
![16](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/16.jpg)

Do not copy files, import .C and .H directly from the package location 

Advantages: small size, saving hard disk space

Disadvantages: If you copy it to another computer or the location of the software package changes, you need to modify the corresponding path   



## After Generated

While loop add the following two lines of code

![17](https://github.com/knightsummon/STM32-HAL-Library-From-Scrach/blob/main/02.%20Light%20up%20LED.assets/17.jpg)

Add this two codes into the main function

```c
    HAL_Delay(500);
    HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOE, GPIO_PIN_15);
```
